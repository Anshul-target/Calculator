To get the content inside the <button> tag, you can use the event object in the onClick handler to access the target element's properties. Specifically, you can use the event.target.textContent property to retrieve the text content inside the <button> tag.

No, the `onChange` prop is not applicable to `<button>` elements. The `onChange` event is typically used with form elements like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` to detect changes in their values.

For a `<button>` element, you can use the `onClick` prop instead. The `onClick` event is triggered when the button is clicked, allowing you to define the action or behavior that should occur when the button is pressed.

Here's an example of how to use the `onClick` prop with a `<button>` element:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
    // Add your desired logic or function here
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the `handleButtonClick` function will be called, and "Button clicked!" will be logged to the console. You can replace the console log with your own custom logic or function as needed.
